# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please file security-related issues against the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, **please do not file a public issue**. Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature or email the maintainer at <tu-email@ejemplo.com> with the following details:

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue.
* Any potential impact or data exposure.

The maintainer commits to responding within 48â€“72 hours and will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.

## Best Practices

* Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to the repository. Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets instead.
* When reporting a vulnerability, provide as much detail as possible to help reproduce and assess the impact.
* If the issue involves user data, describe the data involved and the scope of exposure privately.
